# YouTube Revanced (No Ads + SponsorBlock)

**Before you start:** upload the four files to your repo root with their exact filenames.

## Step-by-step (clickable links)

1. Remove the original YouTube app  
   - Settings → Apps → YouTube → Uninstall or Disable.  
   - If it is a system app, disable or uninstall updates.

2. Install MicroG  
   - Download: [1] MicroG.apk  
     https://github.com/driyqnn/revanced-youtube-tuts-for-friends-only-/raw/main/%5B1%5D_MicroG.apk  
   - Open the downloaded file to install.  
   - If Android blocks install, allow "Install unknown apps" for your browser or file manager when prompted.

3. Install YouTube Revanced  
   - Download: [2] YouTube Revanced v20.13.41.apk  
     https://github.com/driyqnn/revanced-youtube-tuts-for-friends-only-/raw/main/%5B2%5D_Youtube_Revanced_v20.13.41.apk  
   - Install the APK. If it fails, ensure the official YouTube app is removed.

4. Open app and sign in  
   - Open **YouTube Revanced**.  
   - Tap the profile / login button (lower right).  
   - Sign in with your Google account.

5. Import Revanced settings (SponsorBlock etc.)  
   - Open the import file in your browser:  
     https://github.com/driyqnn/revanced-youtube-tuts-for-friends-only-/raw/main/%5B3%5D_Import%20Settings.txt  
   - On that page, select all the text and copy it.  
   - In YouTube Revanced go: `Profile → Settings → Revanced → Miscellaneous → Import/Export`  
   - Tap Import/Export, long-press the import box, paste the copied text, then tap **Import**.  
   - Restart the app.

6. Optional: Install downloader (Seal)  
   - Download: [4] Seal.apk  
     https://github.com/driyqnn/revanced-youtube-tuts-for-friends-only-/raw/main/%5B4%5D_Seal.apk  
   - Install like the other APKs.

## Quick troubleshooting
- Login fails: reinstall MicroG, then reinstall Revanced, reboot phone, try again.  
- Import fails: ensure you copied the entire raw text from the import file, no extra spaces/lines.  
- Install blocked: enable "Install unknown apps" for the app you use to download.

## Notes
- Links point to the raw files in this repo. Keep the exact filenames in the repo root so links work.
- You control which files you upload. Only use files you trust.
